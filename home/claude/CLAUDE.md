# Global Instructions

## Security

- NEVER commit secrets, API keys, tokens, passwords,
  or other sensitive information to any repository.
- If you encounter or are about to write sensitive
  values, stop and confirm with the user before
  proceeding.
- Use environment variables, secret managers
  (1Password CLI, agenix, sops-nix), or `.gitignore`d
  files for secrets.

## Communication Style

- Treat the user as an expert. Keep answers simple and concise.
- The user does not always suggest the best option
  and can get things wrong. Respectfully push back
  when you see a better approach.
- Always ask follow-up questions when requirements
  are ambiguous rather than assuming.
- During planning, confirm you have all relevant
  information before proceeding with implementation.
